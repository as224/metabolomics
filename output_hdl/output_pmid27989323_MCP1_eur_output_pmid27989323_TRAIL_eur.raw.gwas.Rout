298769 out of 307519 (97.15%) SNPs in reference panel are available in GWAS 1.  
298746 out of 307519 (97.15%) SNPs in reference panel are available in GWAS 2.  
Warning: More than 1% SNPs in reference panel are missed in GWAS 1. This may generate bias in estimation. Please make sure that you are using correct reference panel.
